  <p> Question 4:
  Write a JavaScript program to input sides of a triangle and check whether a triangle is equilateral, scalene or isosceles triangle using if else.</br>
  
   Properties of triangle:</br>
   A triangle is said Equilateral Triangle, if all its sides are equal. If a, b, c are three sides of triangle. Then, the triangle is equilateral only if a == b == c.</br>
   A t[InternetShortcut]

  riangle is said Isosceles Triangle, if its two sides are equal. If a, b, c are three sides of triangle. Then, the triangle is isosceles if either a == b or a == c or b == c.</br>
   A triangle is said Scalene Triangle, if none of its sides are equal.</p>
  
  <p>
	Question 5:
  Write a JavaScript program to input electricity unit charge and calculate the total electricity bill according to the given condition:
  For first 50 units Rs. 0.50/unit</br>
   For next 100 units Rs. 0.75/unit</br>
   For next 100 units Rs. 1.20/unit</br>
  For unit above 250 Rs. 1.50/unit. An</br> additional surcharge of 20% is added to the bill.</br>
  
   For example, input: 20 units then bill is Rs10
   Total Units: 300</br>
   50 * 0.5 = 25</br>
   100 * 0.75 = 75</br>
   100 * 1.2 = 120</br>
   50 * 1.5 = 75</br>
   Total = 295 + 20% surcharge on 295
   Result = INR 354
